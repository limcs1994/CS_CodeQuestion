    How would you implement Binary Search
    - Binary search divides the array into half in every iteration step until it finds the element.
    - It works on the sorted arrays since it compares the values of adjacent elements and then calculates the mid number.
    - If the value of low becomes greater than high at any point, it means the element is not present in the list.
